# react-ui-builder

A simple UI Builder built with React. It provides the option to add three elements namely, label, input and button to the DOM. You can add those elements, drag them to new locations, edit their font size and weight as well as delete them.

Tailwind CSS is used to design the elements on the page. The app is bundled with Webpack and all ES6+ code is transpiled with Babel.
